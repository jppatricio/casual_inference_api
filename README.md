# Causal Inference API

This project aims to enhance the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating causal discovery inference through ToolFormer mechanisms. It provides an API that allows LLMs to interface with state-of-the-art causal inference tools.

WIP

## Features

- FastAPI-based REST API
- Integration with causal inference libraries
- ToolFormer-compatible endpoints for LLM interaction
- Intervention planning algorithms

- ongoing work...

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- pip

## Installation
